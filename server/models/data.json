        "All substances are made from tiny particles called atoms. An atom is the smallest part of an element that can exist. Atoms of each element are represented by their own chemical symbol. A chemical symbol; consists of one or two letters and the first letter is always capital.",

        "John Dalton published his ideas about atoms in 1803. He thought that all matter was made of tiny particles called atoms, which he imagined as tiny spheres that could not be divided.",

        "Nearly 100 years later, J J Thomson carried out experiments and discovered the electron. This led him to suggest the plum pudding model of the atom. In this model, the atom is a ball of positive charge with negative electrons embedded in it - like currants in a Christmas pudding.",

      "Before discovering protons, neutrons and electrons, scientists tried to classify the elements by arranging them in order of their atomic weights. The atomic weight of an element is equivalent to what we now call its relative atomic mass.",
    
      "paragraph2": 
      
      "Early periodic tables were incomplete, since many elements were unknown. Also, some elements were placed in groups with elements that were not similar to them.",

      "paragraph3":

      "Dmitri Mendeleev was a Russian chemist. He wrote chemistry books and was looking for ways to organise the known elements. He published his first periodic table of the elements in 1869. In it, he arranged the elements in order of increasing atomic weights. He also took into account the properties of the elements and their compounds.",

        "The transition elements share some physical properties with all metals; they conduct electricity in the solid and liquid states and they are shiny when freshly cut",

        "Some properties of transition elements are different from those of the metals in group 1. Compared to other metals, most transition metals have;higher melting points, higher densities, greater strength and greater hardness",

        "paragraph2": 
        
        "The word 'pure' is used in chemistry in a different way from its everyday meaning. For example, shops sell cartons labelled as â€˜pure' orange juice. The label means that the contents are just orange juice, with no other substances added. However, the juice is not pure in the chemical sense, because it contains different substances mixed together.",
  
        "paragraph3":

        "Mixtures can be separated by physical processes. These processes do not involve chemical reactions, and no new substances are made.",
